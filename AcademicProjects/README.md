# üìö Academic Projects

This folder showcases the academic projects and lab experiments I've completed during my B.E. in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Saveetha Engineering College. Each project reflects hands-on learning, tool-based implementation, and a strong focus on clarity and structure. I've organized them by subject to make it easier for visitors and recruiters to explore my work.
